## Selection of mobile and web applications created by me.

<br>

#### About this repository:
This is a representative mix of some of the circa 150 apps I built professionally.

The projects were usually done for and with midsize or large enterprise businesses.

Customers were from a wide range of industries and markets,
* including finance, insurance, automotive, consulting, retail, IT, chemical and pharma, 
* in EMEA and the US.

<br>

#### About my role in these projects:
I was in a hybrid role of Developer, Solution Consultant, and Account Executive.

Some applications were public showcases, most were prototypes or real customer projects.

I was the primary contact (sales role) for the customer in most cases.

In almost all cases, the requirements engineering was done by me (presales role).

Design and implementation were done by me (developer role).

Technologies used:
* Frontend: XML, proprietary web service, python, CDATA, csv, xlsx, SQL.

* I would love to tell you more about the individual projects. Please approach me if you are interested.
* In most cases, the business logic is proprietary and cannot be published.
* Wherever possible, the UI has been anonymized and made available to allow a glimpse into the nature of the app.
